			<p>The ARA has given Bagel's famous and possibly infamous sauce, Dragon's Venom, the 2019 award for "Most Dangerous BBQ Sauce." The sauce is notorious for to this point having one death due to consumption of the sauce. This really should be illegal, but we got an award for it so it must be fine.</p>
